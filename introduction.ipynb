    "The content-based approach relies on the similarity of particular items. While using a streaming music service, a user puts likes or dislikes on the songs, creating playlists, or defining beforehand his/her favorite songs/genres/artists. The main idea of a content-based recommendation system is to extract metadata and/or data of songs that a user loved, compare them with metadata/data of other songs in the service's library, and based on this, recommend similar songs to the user.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In turn, a collaborative system is built on the basis of users’ overlapping preferences and ratings of songs. It assumes that if user A and user B express similar preferences, similar songs can be recommended to them, meaning that if user A likes a particular song, it is likely that this song will also appeal to user B, and vice versa."

    "Collaborative filtering is widely used, not only in music services, but in shopping, video-streaming, and social networks. Its assumption - that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future - is true in many occasions in music too. To our knowledge, all major music streaming services nowadays use some kind of collaborative filtering as part of their recommendations.\r\n",
    "However, it has some major drawbacks (generally and specifically in music):\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Cold Start - For a new user, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations. For a new song/artist, there are not enough people that have listened to the song, so it will not be recommended.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Popularity Bias - Recommendations are biased towards popularity, and limits exposure of less-popular, underrated and indie songs and artists (not only newcomers, but also \"unconventional\" ones).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Cultural Barrier - Music is an international language. However, in this method users are almost exclusively recommended with songs of their own language and country (with only American/English as the exception). 'Similar Users' for Collaborative filtering technique primarily means users from the same region, mainly due to their initial playlists or region&language settings, which might cause users to miss songs they could've liked only because they are of foreign origin."

    "Therefore, we decided to emphasize on content-based filtering which helps tackling the two issues explained above.\r\n",
    "In the music field, the 'content' which we'll use consists of:\r\n",
    "1. Audio features (key, liveness, tempo, etc.)\r\n",
    "2. Lyrics analysis\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Recommendation system based on this kind of content does not suffer as much from cold start:\r\n",
    "* From the user's point-of-view, as soon as he chooses a single genre or a song/artist which he loves, content-based filtering can recommend him similar songs to his choices based on their content (much faster and more accurate than trying to find similar users, with their complicated tastes, based on such little data).\r\n",
    "* From the artist's point-of view, as soon as he/she publishes a song, its features can be analyzed and it can be recommended to users who love similar songs, even if no one else has listened to it yet.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Content-based filtering also does not discriminate unpopoular songs/artists or foreign music, since it purely relies on the essence of music - melody and lyrics. Therefore, it encourages users to broaden their horizons - musically and culturally."
