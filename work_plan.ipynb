    "## General Work plan (in my opinion): \r\n",
    "1. ### Give an intro about Collaborative Filtering, Content-based filtering and music recommendations.\r\n",
    "2. ### Raise an hypothesis that content-based filtering (analyzing audio features&lyrics) can increase the recommendation/prediction model's accuracy. \r\n",
    "3. ### Fetch data (audio features and lyrics of songs in the given playlists)\r\n",
    "4. ### Visualize the data in some pretty ways.\r\n",
    "5. ### Implement simple Collaborative Filtering or take it from the web (probably doesn't require machine learning)\r\n",
    "6. ### [Perhaps add other songs from the same artists/albums that a user loves to the prediction in order to make it better.]\r\n",
    "7. ### Using machine learning (probably unsupervised or a combination with supervised), make clusters of similar songs based on audio features. Build a predictor that returns similar songs for each user based on the created clusters and his/her given playlist. Compare to previous method.\r\n",
    "8. ### Repeat the last step, but with lyrics (songs with 'similar' lyrics).\r\n",
    "   1. Unlike audio features, with the lyrics we need to create the features ourselves, using NLP techniques.\r\n",
    "   2. The first method which we implemented is emotions recognition (fetching lexicons for emotions with intensity for each word, and use it with VADER sntiment detection model in order to calculate emotion intensity for each song and each emotion. Perhaps we will enhance these scores using a neural network in order to get more accurate scores).\r\n",
    "   3. Another possible method is Topic Modeling (LSA/LDA) - coupling songs that are similar in their topics.\r\n",
    "   4. Consider translating lyrics for foreign songs.\r\n",
    "9. ### Compare methods and combinations of them, visualize* them and find the best one.\r\n",
    "10. ### *Visualize with graphs (graph-tool, for 2d) and word clouds for clusters"
